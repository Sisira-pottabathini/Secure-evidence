Introduction -
  A Secure Evidence Management System (SEMS) is designed to ensure the integrity, security, and traceability of evidence throughout its lifecycle. It incorporates features such as digital 
  tracking, encrypted storage, and access control to prevent tampering or unauthorized access. The system helps maintain a clear chain of custody and compliance with legal standards.
  By streamlining evidence handling, SEMS supports accountability and enhances the reliability of investigations and legal proceedings.
  
Abstract -
  The Secure Evidence Management System (SEMS) built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) provides a comprehensive solution for secure evidence tracking andmanagement.
  By leveraging MongoDB for scalable data storage and React for an intuitive user interface, SEMS ensures seamless evidence handling with real-time updates and secure access controls. 
  Node.js and Express.js facilitate robust backend processing, enabling secure encryption, audit trails, and efficient management of physical and digital evidence. 
  The system maintains a transparent chain of custody and ensures compliance with legal standards. With its scalable and secure architecture, SEMS enhances the integrity and accountability
  of evidence in investigative and legal processes.


  Tech Stack for Secure Evidence Management System (SEMS):


Frontend:
React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, offering a dynamic and responsive experience for managing evidence.
Redux: For state management, ensuring smooth data flow between components.
Material-UI: A library for designing an intuitive and accessible UI with pre-built components.


Backend:
Node.js: A JavaScript runtime for building fast, scalable server-side applications.
Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js, used to handle HTTP requests, routing, and middleware for a RESTful API.
JWT (JSON Web Tokens): For secure authentication and authorization between the frontend and backend.


Database:
MongoDB: A NoSQL database, ideal for handling large volumes of data with flexible schema, and storing evidence records in a scalable manner.
Mongoose: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js to streamline database interactions.


Security & Authentication:
OAuth 2.0: A secure authorization protocol for ensuring that only authorized users can access sensitive evidence data.
JWT (JSON Web Tokens): For secure authentication, ensuring that users' sessions are safely managed with encrypted tokens.
Bcrypt.js: A hashing algorithm for securely storing passwords and sensitive user data.
HTTPS/TLS: For encrypting data transmitted between client and server to prevent interception.


Cloud Services:
AWS (Amazon Web Services):
S3 (Simple Storage Service): For securely storing large files and evidence records.
EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud): For hosting backend services in a scalable, secure environment.
RDS (Relational Database Service): If any relational database is needed for specific evidence metadata.
IAM (Identity and Access Management): For managing user permissions and access controls.
Firebase (for Authentication): A cloud-based solution for quick and secure user authentication, real-time database, and push notifications.
This tech stack ensures a secure, scalable, and efficient evidence management system, optimizing both performance and security in line with legal standards.
