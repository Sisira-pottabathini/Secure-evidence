Introduction -
  A Secure Evidence Management System (SEMS) is designed to ensure the integrity, security, and traceability of evidence throughout its lifecycle. It incorporates features such as digital 
  tracking, encrypted storage, and access control to prevent tampering or unauthorized access. The system helps maintain a clear chain of custody and compliance with legal standards.
  By streamlining evidence handling, SEMS supports accountability and enhances the reliability of investigations and legal proceedings.
  
Abstract -
  The Secure Evidence Management System (SEMS) built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) provides a comprehensive solution for secure evidence tracking andmanagement.
  By leveraging MongoDB for scalable data storage and React for an intuitive user interface, SEMS ensures seamless evidence handling with real-time updates and secure access controls. 
  Node.js and Express.js facilitate robust backend processing, enabling secure encryption, audit trails, and efficient management of physical and digital evidence. 
  The system maintains a transparent chain of custody and ensures compliance with legal standards. With its scalable and secure architecture, SEMS enhances the integrity and accountability
  of evidence in investigative and legal processes.
